# Skin Parts Refresher
A simple mod for Minecraft 1.19.3 and higher versions.  
Requires [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) to work.

### What does it do and Why use it?
For some reason, minecraft servers (especially 1.19.3) won't send you your skin parts if you enter another dimension, 
and it makes your skin looks **ugly**.  

With this mod, your skin parts will be refreshed if you enter *another dimension*.  
It can be very useful if you don't want to refresh it manually.

### How to use it?
After installing this mod, it will automatically refresh your skin parts if you enter a world or server.  
If it doesn't refresh skin parts for you, you can simply press `N` to refresh your skin parts manually.
