# Show My Skin Parts
A simple mod for Minecraft 1.19.3 and higher versions.  
The configure screen requires `Cloth Config` and `Mod Menu` to open (or you can edit the configuration file manually).

###  Why use it and What does it do?
For some reason, some minecraft servers (especially 1.19.3) won't send you your skin parts if you enter another dimension, 
and it makes your skin looks **ugly**.  

With this mod, your skin parts will always be shown (Following the client's skin options).  
And it will automatically "refresh" your skin parts in order to enable your skin parts to be seen to others (It's configurable).  
If other players still cannot see your skin parts, you can simply press `N` to refresh your skin parts manually.

### Notice
This mod doesn't seem work well with 3d-Skin-Layers, so please disable it first and try again before reporting bugs if it's installed.
